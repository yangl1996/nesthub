Nesthub is a bridge between Nest thermostats and Apple HomeKit.

How Nesthub is different from HomeBridge:

+ Written in pure Golang.
    + Easy cross compilation. Compile on your Mac and deploy on a Raspberry Pi!
    + No dependency to install on the target machine.
    + No JavaScript, npm, Node.JS, thank you very much!
+ Very small in size.
+ One single binary to deploy.
+ The program simply runs in the foreground. No background service to manage.
    + Although you could write your own systemd service/init script.
+ Uses the official Google Smart Device Management API. Not a single hack here.

- Google SDM API requires a one-time fee of $5. Shame on you, Google!
- No fancy UI. Probably only for someone who knows how to work the command line.
- Setup is somewhat complicated.

Highlights on the system design:

+ Uses SDM pubsub event stream. No active polling of the SDM API.
    + Does not hit the ridiculously low API rate limit.
+ Device state query (e.g. check temperature) is entirely local. (Low latency.)

This project uses hc for a pure-go implementation of the HomeKit Accessory
Protocol. hc is authored by Matthias Hochgatterer and other contributors.
